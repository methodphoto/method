# {{page.title}}

The evolution of the Shazam for iPhone Home Screen. The first version had a small button on the top right of the screen called 'Tag Now'.

Users found it hard to point the microphone at the music source and tap the button (due to the way UI elements were configured to work on the iPhone).

The big leap was the big Touch to Shazam button which meant it was easy to tap. Later versions allowed the app to start listening as soon as it was opened.
